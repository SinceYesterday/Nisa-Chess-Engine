# About The Project
Nisa is a Chess Engine written from scratch in the C++ programming language and has the strength to face to face the chess master players (FIDE 2200 - 2500)

Nisa means water in the Zapotec Language; a native language from Mexico

# Usage
Nisa is the brain of a chess engine. It uses the universal chess interface (UCI) to communicate with other engines.

You can ask Nisa to evaluate a position through the command line by typing UCI commands but itâ€™s recommended to install a GUI.

# Feactures
- 0x88 board representation 
- Interative deeping search
- Alpha-Beta Search
- Quiet search
- Transposition table
- Null move pruning
- Late move reduction
- Futility pruning
- Incremental evaluation

Nisa uses a PESTO by Ronald Friederich to evaluate a position.

# RoadMap
